## How it is deployed

I am hosting the domain "enzgroupnj.com" on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), where I configured the DNS settings through Cloud DNS and set up either a Compute Engine virtual machine or Google Cloud Storage for hosting. I secured the site with SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS access and utilized GCP's Load Balancing and Cloud CDN for enhanced performance and scalability. Additionally, I implemented Cloud Monitoring and Logging to track performance and address any issues, ensuring a reliable online presence.
